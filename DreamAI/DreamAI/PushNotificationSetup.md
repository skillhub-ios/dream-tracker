## Implementation Details

### PushNotificationManager Features:
- **Permission Management:** Requests and tracks notification permissions
- **Token Registration:** Handles device token registration with APNs
- **Token Display:** Shows device token in UI for easy copying
- **Notification Handling:** Processes incoming notifications
- **Foreground Display:** Shows notifications even when app is active
- **Background Processing:** Handles notifications when app is in background

### UI Integration:
- **Permissions Screen:** Toggle for enabling notifications + device token display
- **Profile Settings:** Notification toggle + tap to copy device token
- **Real-time Status:** Shows registration status and authorization state

### Notification Categories:
The app defines these notification categories for different actions:
- `DREAM_REMINDER` - Daily dream recording reminders

- `WEEKLY_INSIGHTS` - Weekly dream pattern reports

### Custom Data:
Each notification can include custom data for app-specific actions:

- `action` - Action to perform when notification is tapped
- Additional context data as needed

## Testing Workflow

1. **Enable Notifications:**
   - Open app and go to permissions screen
   - Toggle notifications on
   - Grant permission when prompted

2. **Get Device Token:**
   - Copy the device token from the permissions screen
   - Or tap the notification row in profile settings

3. **Send Test Notification:**
   - Go to Apple Developer Portal
   - Use the notification dashboard
   - Paste device token and payload
   - Send notification

4. **Verify Reception:**
   - Check if notification appears on device
   - Verify app handles notification properly
   - Test both foreground and background scenarios

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Device token not available:**
   - Ensure notifications are enabled in app
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify APNs certificate is valid
   - Ensure app has proper entitlements

2. **Notifications not appearing:**
   - Check notification permissions in Settings
   - Verify device token is correct
   - Ensure app is not in Do Not Disturb mode
   - Check notification payload format

3. **Background notifications not working:**
   - Verify "Remote notifications" background mode is enabled
   - Check that notification payload includes required fields
   - Ensure app is properly registered for background processing

### Debug Information:
- Device token is displayed in both permissions and profile screens
- Registration status is shown in real-time
- Console logs show detailed registration and notification events
- Tap notification row in profile to copy token to clipboard

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration:** Implement server-side token storage and notification sending
2. **Analytics:** Track notification engagement and effectiveness
3. **Personalization:** Allow users to customize notification preferences
4. **Rich Notifications:** Add images and interactive buttons to notifications
